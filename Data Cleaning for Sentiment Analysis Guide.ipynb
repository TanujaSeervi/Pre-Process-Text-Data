    "Data preprocessing and cleaning is an essential step in building a Machine Learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know Machine Learning needs data in the numeric form. We basically used encoding technique (BagOfWord, Bi-gram,n-gram, TF-IDF, Word2Vec) to encode text into numeric vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing steps are:\n",
    "1. Remove URL.\n",
    "2. Remove all irrelevant characters (Numbers and Punctuation).\n",
    "3. Convert all characters into lowercase.\n",
    "4. Tokenization\n",
    "5. Removing Stopwords\n",
    "6. Stemming\n",
    "7. Lemmatization\n",
    "8. Remove the words having length <= 2\n",

    "These are wideley used for dimensionality reduction.\n",
